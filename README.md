# BMI6016_VectorDB

`BMI6016-VectorDB.ipynb` is a notebook walking through some basic examples of how Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vector DBs can be utilized. Specifically, we walk through:

* vectorize `.pdfs` through transformer model
  * load into vector DB
* querying documents in the vector DB using basic similarity search and MMR
* installing a Llama 2 chat model and prompting it
* using that Llama 2 model to 'chat' with the vector DB
* how to prompt OpenAI model via API
* how LLMs can be used to generate structured data from unstructured
